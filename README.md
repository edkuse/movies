# My Favorite Movie Site

A simple yet cool program that generates an awesome looking web page 
that shows you your favorite movies and their trailers.

## Usage
Install and view your site quickly by running `python entertainment_center.py` 
from the command line.  Ensure that all files reside in the same folder.

```shell
python entertainment_center.py
```

## Documentation
The web page's interface is very straightforward and intuitive.  By clicking 
anywhere on a movie's poster image or title, a popup will appear and start 
playing that movie's trailer.

To the right of each movie title is a blue little info icon.  When clicking 
on the icon, you'll see that movie's storyline!
